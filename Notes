Main div will center all the css

List div:
throw at least 3 items into it 
Main goal: to use <ul>
Must have a border and distinguised so you can see its layout
Extra Credit: Add JS to animated GIF with animated pinwheel for loading that will fill in the list with something
    Fill in the list dynamically


Error Message
Set to invisible or none: difference = none has no space

Extra credit: Make a button look like an X using CSS only when it is present to close it
- onclick, make it hidden


Needs to validate 2 properties --> have a function to do this
1. Name field (null)
2. Age 1 < x < 100

ways to do it:
1. Have 2 error messages
2. Have 1 central one and fill it in dynamically with the variable (name,age)
